## Workflow
### Branch Creation
- Create new branch off of latest changes from master
- Name the branch `feature/<brief description of new feature delimited by dashes>`

### Code
- Write neat code, reduce copy pasted code but leave refactoring to last
- Once functionality is captured and code is satisfactory:
  - Write Junit 5 tests
  - Write JavaDoc for your code

### PR Creation

- Request reviews from any two members of the team
